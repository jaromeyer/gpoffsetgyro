A small Python script to modify the accelerometer data coming from a GoPro to use ReelSteady Go's horizon lock feature with a setup where the mainboard is mounted offset from the sensor. It could be very useful for the coming ultralight cinematic drones aka "cinewhoops" which are equipped with torn apart GoPro Hero cameras to save precious weight. Check out the [NakeX](https://fpvframe.ch/fpvx/product/nakex-bnf/) from fpvframe.ch to get an idea of what cinewhoops are.
